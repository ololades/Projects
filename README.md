## Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning
Data transformation
Feature engineering
Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Training the Machine Learning Model:

Model selection
Hyperparameter tuning
Training the model on the preprocessed data
Evaluating the performance of the model on the testing set

## Creating a Flask Web Application:

Setting up a virtual environment
Installing Flask
Creating the Flask app
Creating an API endpoint for the machine learning model

## Testing the Web Application:

Using tools like Postman to send test requests to the API endpoint
Verifying that the predictions are accurate

## Deploying the Web Application:

Selecting a web server provider (e.g. Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Platform)
Creating an account and setting up the web server
Deploying the Flask app to the web server

## Monitoring and Maintaining the Web Application:

Updating dependencies and packages as needed
Monitoring server logs for errors or issues
Responding to any issues that arise to ensure the application continues to function correctly.
